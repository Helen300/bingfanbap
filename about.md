## Food in my life has been...

1. something of a luxury. Getting to eat delicious food was not something I remember too much as a kid unless I was eating outside or at my aunt's house. My parent's were rarely home and thus I was set on the journey of learning to cook myself. But of course, just cause I was learning to cook on my own didn't mean that I was looking up recipes or cookbooks. I was simply trying to do it from what I had seen others do in the past or by common sense. I definitely don't think this experience taught me proper cooking techniques or understand what ingredients actually go well with each other. Often time, I would make a mash up of things or eat the same things repeatedly. Oh, one more thing, I was not a heavy seasoner...

2. something of learning. I remember downloading Snapchat in high school and one of the things I got hooked on was the stories and videos from Food Network and Tasty. I felt like I was learning more about how to make good food 

3. something of hard work but a means. Working at JoJu in the last two years of highschool. My immigrant parents who have been working in restaurants ever since they came to the U.S. But is that really a way to escape and to reach what they came to the U.S. for? 

4. something of self-discovery. Learning about myself, what I like, dislike, what I enjoy doing. Learning about what makes me happy. Learning about my culture and my connections with my family roots. 

5. something of coping and getting up. Making food for my loved ones was something that kept me going everyday when I was feeling down. I had many high and lows but when I was able to get up and cook, I felt productive and felt like I was doing something that was truly of value and something that mattered. Instead of scrolling on my phone or watching tv until my eyes dried out, I was using my senses to make food. Watching the food brown, watching it sizzle, working through the dough until my arms gave out. It was a driving force for when I couldn't otherwise see a way out.
