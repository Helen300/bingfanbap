## About About Pages

Food has always been something of a luxury for me. Getting to eat delicious food was not something I remember too much as a kid unless I was eating outside or at my aunt's house. My parent's were rarely home and thus I was set on the journey of learning to cook myself. But of course, just cause I was learning to cook on my own didn't mean that I was able to learn the proper techniques or know what things went well with each other. Often time, I would make a mash up of things or eat the same things repeatedly. Oh, one more thing, I was not a heavy seasoner...

Came COVID, I was stuck at home and after having been exposed to a new world of foods at Princeton, I got into baking more often and also thinking more about myself and my culture.
